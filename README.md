In the Bachelor's Thesis, a dataset was collected by doing experiments, and various data analysis and machine learning algorithms were applied to extract meaningful results. The collected data was cleaned, followed by data splitting to prepare it for machine learning applications. Penalization methods like RIDGE, LASSO or ELASTICNET were not necessary in our case. Normalization was done in order to get more accurate results. Afterward, models like Support Vector regression, Gradient Descent, Ordinary Least square, Decision tree regression were implemented. The datasets were trained, and their performance was evaluated on a test dataset. Better results were obtained using cross-validation. Subsequently, performance metrics, graphs, and the created models were documented within the scope of the Bachelor's Thesis.
