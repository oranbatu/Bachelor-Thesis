In the undergraduate thesis, a dataset was collected, and various data analysis and machine learning algorithms were applied to extract meaningful results. The collected data was cleaned, followed by data splitting to prepare it for machine learning applications. Afterward, various machine learning models were implemented. The datasets were trained, and their performance was evaluated on a test dataset. Better results were obtained using cross-validation. Subsequently, performance metrics, graphs, and the created models were documented within the scope of the undergraduate thesis.
